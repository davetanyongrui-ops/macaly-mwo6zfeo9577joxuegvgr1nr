Too often, we have seen students who yearn to enrich themselves towards international standards only to be held back by barriers of high costs, distance and time away from family and loved ones as well as limited access to resources.<br><br>At the same time, we realized that traditional schools are focusing too much on academic memorization and results, while failing to prepare students for the future, A world that is experiencing constant change driven by the growing trend of intense global competition and most importantly, the evolution and perhaps potential threat of AI today.<br><br>Hence the mission of ALFA Learning.  To combine and harnesh the strength of our local, Singapore as well as internationally qualified teachers to form a future-proof and future-ready curriculum, delivered online at an affordable rate. The mission of Alfa Learning goes beyond textbooks — we aspire to nurture critical thinkers, problem-solvers, and confident learners who are ready to take on higher university pursuits, career advancements and the world ahead."
